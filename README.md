🚀 Summary

LLM/AI Engineer with end-to-end experience shipping agentic chatbots, RAG pipelines, and computer-vision / NLP systems. I build production-grade ML features and infra (ingestion → retrieval → model → eval/observability) focused on measurable product impact. Skilled in Python, LangChain / LangGraph, Flask, Docker, and AWS; experienced with vector DBs (FAISS, Pinecone, Qdrant) and evaluation harnesses.

🔎 Currently

Open to roles in LLM engineering, RAG systems, and AI/agents. I’m actively shipping RAG chatbots and instrumentation for observability and eval.
